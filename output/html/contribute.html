    <h3>Try and Tell</h3>
    <p>You can help BOLTS by just trying it out and giving us feedback. Whether you are using <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> or <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, just <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/index.html">install and use it</a> and tell us</p>
    <ul>
      <li>what didn't work</li>
      <li>what was confusing for you</li>
      <li>what you think could be done in a better way</li>
      <li>where the documentation should be improved</li>
      <li>how BOLTS could be more useful for you</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are many ways to reach us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can send mails to <a href="mailto:BOLTS@ist-dein-freund.de">BOLTS@ist-dein-freund.de</a>
      <li>Problems with the documentation can be reported via the comments section embedded on each page.</p>
      <li>For FreeCAD related things, there is a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/free-cad/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4549">development thread</a> on the FreeCAD forums.
      <li>The <a href="https://github.com/jreinhardt/BOLTS/issues">BOLTS issue tracker</a> on GitHub is also a good place to report problems and discuss improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Add more parts and drawings</h3>
    <p>You can also help with adding more parts to BOLTS or improving those that are already there. To do so, you should first read about a few basic things, that will be useful to know</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/general/introduction.html">A short introduction to BOLTS</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/general/development.html">BOLTS development with git</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once you have done that you are prepared to contribute by</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/general/blt-files.html">adding collections and classes</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/freecad/basefunction.html">adding base functions (FreeCAD)</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/openscad/basemodule.html">adding base modules (OpenSCAD)</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/doc/general/drawing.html">create drawings</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>BOLTS scans its database for inconsistencies, common problems, missing or unclear information and automatically generates <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tasks.html">a list of things that could be fixed or improved</a>. This is a great starting point for contributing to BOLTS</p>
